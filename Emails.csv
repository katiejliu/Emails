You need to learn how to be a good listener. I have no doubt that you can talk very well, I hope you can listen very well too. As I told you many many times, I always love you no matter what. Both you and little brother Alex, you are both daddy and mommy's kids, we love you both equally. Since Alex is very little and requires the care most of the time, we may spend more time with him than with you. But it doesn't mean we love him more than we love you. We love you both the same.

Hope I am still your best friend no matter what. As I told you, I always want to be with you and Alex. When I am old and retired, I will buy a house close to where you live, so I can still see you every day or every week.

I'm also very glad that you are loving reading. It is a great thing to read. In this way, you can not only learn a lot of new knowledge, but also experience life in another way. Sometime, you can not get those feeling in real life, but you still can get it from book. I believe you will understand it, even now not.

It is a kind of surprise to me that you do not like the book of ""Harry Potter"". You told me that the story will make you scary. Katie, the storyline of the book is based on IMAGINATION. Imagination is the seasoning for the life, especially for a kid. Dream will make you think big. Life is nothing without imagination or dreaming. There is nothing to scare you. Katie, no one will hurt you without reason, just like no one will love you without reason. So, you do not need to be afraid of anything in book, especially the one generated from imagination.

One thing to be success such as being a fashion designer is to be persistent. It means that you always stick to it and never give up. Sometime I noticed that you are having a passion of 3 minutes, i.e. your focus to one thing is not long enough. Persistence is one critical factor to be successful, such as I persistently ask your mom to marry me. We will support you as always, including for you getting a dreaming job. I'm not sure what classes you need to take and I will talk with your mom.

"Sun, Jul 19, 2009 at 7:59 PM","Katie,

I'm sorry that I was tough to you during weekend. It was not my intention to be rude to you.

Katie, I know you are very proud of yourself, same as me. However, I know that sometimes you are actually trying to behave strong to cover your non-self-confidence. I understand this feeling very well since I'm your daddy. Katie, you are a kid. No one will blame you if you tried. They are same for piano playing, swimming, bicycling et al. In US, one can not success until she is a team player. To be a team player, you must be an independent individual first. Sports is the best way to train you in this. This is the reason daddy and mommy is pushing you on this.

You are doing very well on your breath-excising for your vocal class. So you will be terrific on swimming since you can hold your breath very well. Do not be afraid! It is same for everything. Do not be afraid that other kids or people will say that you are not good. Katie, you are very good. But no one is perfect, non one is good in everything. So learning is a way to be better and better. That is the life. Learning from failure rather than being afraid of trying.

As always, health is number one. Be careful of your back posture. If necessary, daddy can buy you a posture corrective brace. But I wish you can realize it and correct by yourself.

Have a wonderful day.

Take care of mommy, alex, and grandma.",Parent

Hope you under stand.",Kid
"Tue, Sep 29, 2009 at 6:51 AM","The lock of TV is not an intension. As a well-behaved kid, you do not need someone to force you to do or not to do something. All the rules are trying to help you being focused.
 
I think you do not need do biography. You have familiar with the structure of that type of article and have practiced enough. Also for book report, a big one from Harry Port is enough. You can even write a report from watching a DVD. Do not keep doing those simple stuff you have known. It will not improve your writting. You can just write one big book report in one week, rather than 5 repeated short biography or book report. Do you understand?
 
I do not want you to be a book worm during track out. You still need to go outside, and go downstairs to play with Alex, help grandma and mom et al.
 
You may stay in your room for study for 2hr in morning, 2~2.5 hr in afernoon. Besides study, you may spend half ~ 1hr in watching TV and internet, half hr in sports, half hr in piano.

Katie, how about your track out. I will be home next Friday, but may be pretty busy such as set up the bed and computer. Connie, would you please help katie on her writting, or would you take a picture of the article and then email me. I can make suggestion on changing and bring it next Friday.

How about your scientific projects? Have you finished first two?

1) for the first one, you can use ""trial and error"" method (also called target-shooting method or 试差法, if you have not learned ""divide"". To calculate an area, you need to measure two lengths for rectangular (just need one for circle, why?  think of it.) Then you will know what tool you need. You will find that the measurement unit is not important for the ratio calculation

2) for the second one, I give a hint that   1) Distance =  Speed * Time, or vise verso  2) Speed = distance /time.  So you need to know your speed of walking first by equation 2) , then use trial method and equation 1) to get the time for certain distance. You need ask mom or google about unit conversion for distance from mile to ft. You know how to measure time and distance, and we have tools for both at home.",Parent

Time is limited as always, you will realize it later. First of all, health is most important. To improve your health, you need to participate in sports. Scootering, Wii, running/jogging et al can help you. Sitting properly during homework is also essential.
 
Second most important thing is your characters: personality. Some of them are very difficult to change since they can be from daddy and mom. But you can try to change. For example, you need to be generous to everyone, not only Alex. Also be brave and determined. Always having a positive attitude, rather than the ""whatever"" attitude.

"Fri, January 8, 2010 8:41:14 AM","I would suggest that you add some product in the store. I would suggest you make some art project following the book you received as gift in Christmas. You can sell the art piece in higher price and make larger profit. If you build enough, you may sell on the neighborhood and receive some money. In this case, you can donate the money to help poor people.
 
I would like to buy those article piece made by you. If it is original and full of imagination, I think I will buy it for more than $20. Mom will do that also.
 
Good luck.
 
BTW, it is not so necessary to spend much time on some thing you are caplabe such as math exercise with two digintal adding. On other hand, if you focus and hence improve the efficiency, you can achieve same result with less time. WIth more left spare time, you can do something you are really interested, such as art piece making, which I think it is good for your future dreaming job as fashion designer.

To write an essay applying a new school, you have two main topics: 1) introduce yourself; 2) why you want to go to new school. Your final goal is that the reader such as the principle in school want you at his school after read your letter (Dad know there is lottery by lucky), so all your writing needs focus on this.

About Self:
     To a person, the most important thing is family, personality, interests and hobbies, as well as job (things doing daily). As a student, the job is your study and activity. So it is obvious, you need to write something about family, personality, interests and hobbies, as well as study. To describe each item, you can illustrate by a small story, an achievement, a score report et al., rather than some boring and simple sentences.
For example, you can write ""I'm working hard"". then, you can give an example: how you meet a challenge or difficulty, how you work hard to try to solve it. how you solved it, and finally very important how you feel afterwards, which is the result of your working hard. Learning scoot is a good sample. it is same as ""learning any new stuff"", including study.
You can write "" I like music especially piano"". You can write "" practiced every day, so on and on, and you can won some certificates"". Or you love dancing, and you enjoyed the performance in the stay and the family enjoyed watching your show.
In these stories, describing how you think and feel is very important.
You can frankly talk about your hobbies.

Why New School
    You should describe from two sides: 1) inside and 2) outside. Inside means your side, i.e your motivation. Outside is the factor out of you, such as school, family, friend, society.

    Your side: why you want to new school.
 I think you can write how you want to learn new and more advanced knowledge. How you eager to learn. Katie, life is about family and experiencing in new stuff. The knowledge is the key to explore new stuff. More knowledge, more chance you can explore. Do you agree? You can write a lot about this, such as how a new experience excited you such as a travel in China. While you also need to emphasize that knowledge is helping you to build experience.

    Outside:
New school is the most important factor since this is the reason you are writing this essay. So you need study the new school by learning from the website. What are attracting you? What are curious to you? All these you can write in the essay. Of course, you may mention that they have excellent teacher, campus, academic performance, activity program et al. How they meet your dream such as aritist? Of course, you should NOT say any bad words about current school. You just need say that new school will meet you better.

Other factor can be such as society demand. For example, now the world is a global village. You want to learn other languages in order to travel, work in foreign countries. So you want to learn something to meet the requirement from society, such as a foreign language, meeting new friends (to more social) et al.

Katie, I believe you can write as much as your fiction if you try to understand what dad is saying and focus on the writing.

Good luck. I will try to find some sample letter for you. It is difficult to find (only colleges)

" Tue, March 23, 2010 8:25:29 PM","Hope you have a wonderful birthday and a bright 9-year-old. Next year, my little Katie will become teenage ... Lots of trouble 

One thing I need to mention again is that you need to be more generous. You are even not generous to your brother Alex. I'm not saying that Alex can break any toy, or especially something you love. But You do not need to be mad. I can imagine that sometime you will be not so generous to your friends also.

Material stuff is not so important since they can be bought using money. Of course, you are not earning money now. But I believe katie will earn money after hard study and grow up. Do not worry about that. Dad and Mom will support you based on our consideration. So you do not need to worry about money at your age. Sometime you worried too much on this such as when Dad was buying cookie for you.

On the other hand, feeling or love is more important. As you see, Alex first speaks ""JieJie"", which indicates he loves you very much. I know sometime he is spoiled and will yell to get what he wants. But you do not need to cry or be mad. Nevertheless, you will not cherish something which you like when you are much young.

At last, hope you enjoy the books I bought for you as birthday gift. My consideration is that you will prepare to learn somehting about China before Mom bring you to China this Fall. Traveling is expanding your knowledge, meeting people and make new friends.

" Thu, April 29, 2010 10:23:53 AM","I talked with Grandma today about your quarrel with her yesterday. I believe that I know what happened. If it is not true as described, please tell me.
 
When Alex is crying, you are kind to offer grandma hep to stop his crying. It is very nice of you.
When Grandma said you may not be able to stop him and your effect may be useless. She is stating a truth, maybe a little bit straightforward. But she did nothing wrong.
 
Then you responded as "" You are too rude to me"", which is totally impolite. Then you said "" You are sick"". This is totally out of boundary. ""You are sick"" may be used to mom or dad since we are friend and family and know you are kind of joking. But it is kind of curse to others, especially to old people in Chinese. It drove grandma crying.
 
Above all, not only this thing, all other things have reflected that you do not respect others, especially NOT appreciate other people's efforts to help you or care you. Grandma also told me that you usually say ""You are sick"" even when she puller your hair by accident when she is helping you to comb the hair. You need appreciate it.
 
Here are the things I suggest:
1) Appology to grandma, take back what you said
2) Be appreciating other's effort. What you have or going to have from family, friend is not naturelly there. It is other people's effort to make you comfortable, happy, not hundary, keeping warm et al.
 
I will be back this weekend. I hope this thing is resolved smoothly.
 ",Parent
"Thu, April 29, 2010 6:06:04 PM","I didn't say that""she was sick"". I said to her that I though she was mad at me(which made her cry), because she said that if she can't stop Alex from crying you can't either and also said it in a rough and loud voice. The note below maybe also right and my note could be wrong, because it was from different points of view. You can think grandma's version is correct (because you are her son) ,but I may not. Like I said it is from different points of view.  
Hope you understand.",Kid
"Thu, Apr 29, 2010 at 3:24 PM","I believe you have said ""Ni You Bin"" in Chinese, i.e. you have sickness or you are sick in English. You always say that time and time to us, and maybe you did not realize that you have said it.

It is not about the fact on what happened yesterday. Basically you can not say ""Ni You Bin"" to grandma. Maybe there is misunderstanding between you two, but you can not say that, period.

Please apology to Grandma on that. I did not think that you are wrong on helping Alex. On the contrast, you are nice.

FACT IS ALWAYS SAME whatever the viewpoint. 

Sometime you just can not control your temp, like me. it will hurt people, just like I did to your mom. Pleae apology on that, which is at least you should do. I also want you to appreciate other people's efforts.",Parent

Just want to talk with you. As a father, I have huge responsibility to make you happy and grow up to be a happy woman. Due to job, daddy must be out of town for a while. I wish that I can be back by the end of this year.
 
Thanks again for the card. I forgot it is father's day this weekend. Otherwise I will book the ticket early.
 
I think you have lots of good characters, but also bad ones. Among them, two are most obvious:
1) not so generous
2) not so brave
 
To be generous, you need to be sympathy to others. Until you love, care and worry about others, then you will be generous. In this world, there are more people poorer than us, you need to learn to share, care, and contribute. You can start from treating your brother Alex. He is your family and still young, you need take care of him. Sometime you are doing very well.
 
To be brave, you just do not need to worry about something will not happen or does not matter. You do not need to care about how others will think, such as they will laught at you when you are learning something. It is ok to be stupid when you are learning something. It is be a shame if you never learn something because you are afraid of failure. For example, you really do not need to worry during swimming since your safety is garanteed. I will be there as well as the safe guard.
 
Of course, to be brave does not mean that you do something carelessly. For example swiming alone or walk outside in dark. But our community is quite safe and I encourage you to ride/bike outside nearby. Of course, you need to learn how to protect yourself by equipment. In case, you need yell if someone want to hurt you.
 
So long for today. Daddy is not mad at you. But want to be always at my little girl's side.

Those kids are somehow blinded and narrow minded since they do not know China by themselves. World is changing fast and what they know from their parents are not correct anymore.
 
I think it is a good topic for you to have  a project as "" China of 2010"" or ""Shanghai 2010"". As it says, one figure is better than thousand words. So I would suggest you to take pictures of daily life in China and put a post in School.
 
I have some ideas on the topics which you should take pictures on. We can discuss during night or weekend. Basically you should think over what does daily life compose of?  I will send you in another email on the topics I have. I wish you can think over it first.

Facing critism is one of essential factor to be sucess for you in future. Of course, you can judge the critism by self. If you think it is correct, then you should try to improve it or change your behavior. If you think it is not correct, try to reason or just ignore it. But being hysterical or yelling back is a behavior without class.

To understand nature, you need learn math, science et al. Nature is governed by lots of laws, which is abstracted in science or can be described in math equations.

To understand society, you need learn language as well social. Learning multiple language is desirable for you to understand people around the world, while making friends can directly make you familiar with the life around the states or different countries. I wish you do make more friends.

3) be confident and control your anger. Respect others not only in school, but at home.
4) be appreciative of the love and given from others

There are other ways to prevent mistake before hand. Usually you make error when you do not understand something or there is a problem.
 
If you do not know something, you can always consult Daddy and Mommy for these.
 
If there is a problem, there are seven main steps to follow when trying to solve a problem.  These steps are as follows:
1.    Define and Identify the Problem
2.    Analyze the Problem
3.    Identifying Possible Solutions
4.    Selecting the Best Solutions
